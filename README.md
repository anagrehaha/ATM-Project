# ATM-Project
This is one of my programming personal projects at the university
This project was an assignment when I taken tha Unix course at the university
Project Assginment:
Write a C program that deals with ATM cards.  
Each ATM card should have the following information: • Holder Name: Full name of the person who owns the card (first name and last name). • Card number: a 6 digits number. • Expiration date: month and year of expiration. • Balance: amount of available money in the card. • Pin number: a 3-digits number.
